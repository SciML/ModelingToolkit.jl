An index-1 DAE always satisfies that the Jacobian of the algebraic equations is non-singular. Here, the first 4 equations are differential equations, with the last term the algebraic relationship. However, the partial derivative of x^2 + y^2 - L^2 w.r.t. T is zero, and thus the Jacobian of the algebraic equations is the zero matrix, and thus it's singular.
