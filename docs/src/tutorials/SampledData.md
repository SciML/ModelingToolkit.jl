# Clocks and Sampled-Data Systems

A sampled-data system contains both continuous-time and discrete-time components, such as a continuous-time plant model and a discrete-time control system. ModelingToolkit supports the modeling and simulation of sampled-data systems by means of *clocks*.

!!! danger "Experimental"
    
    The sampled-data interface is currently experimental and at any time subject to breaking changes **not** respecting semantic versioning.

!!! note "Negative shifts"
    
    The initial release of the sampled-data interface **only supports negative shifts**.

A clock can be seen as an *event source*, i.e., when the clock ticks, an event is generated. In response to the event the discrete-time logic is executed, for example, a control signal is computed. For basic modeling of sampled-data systems, the user does not have to interact with clocks explicitly, instead, the modeling is performed using the operators

  - [`Sample`](@ref)
  - [`Hold`](@ref)
  - [`ShiftIndex`](@ref)

When a continuous-time variable `x` is sampled using `xd = Sample(x, dt)`, the result is a discrete-time variable `xd` that is defined and updated whenever the clock ticks. `xd` is *only defined when the clock ticks*, which it does with an interval of `dt`. If `dt` is unspecified, the tick rate of the clock associated with `xd` is inferred from the context in which `xd` appears. Any variable taking part in the same equation as `xd` is inferred to belong to the same *discrete partition* as `xd`, i.e., belonging to the same clock. A system may contain multiple different discrete-time partitions, each with a unique clock. This allows for modeling of multi-rate systems and discrete-time processes located on different computers etc.

To make a discrete-time variable available to the continuous partition, the [`Hold`](@ref) operator is used. `xc = Hold(xd)` creates a continuous-time variable `xc` that is updated whenever the clock associated with `xd` ticks, and holds its value constant between ticks.

The operators [`Sample`](@ref) and [`Hold`](@ref) are thus providing the interface between continuous and discrete partitions.

The [`ShiftIndex`](@ref) operator is used to refer to past and future values of discrete-time variables. The example below illustrates its use, implementing the discrete-time system

```math
x(k+1) = 0.5x(k) + u(k)
y(k) = x(k)
```

```@example clocks
using ModelingToolkit
using ModelingToolkit: t_nounits as t
@variables x(t) y(t) u(t)
dt = 0.1                # Sample interval
clock = Clock(t, dt)    # A periodic clock with tick rate dt
k = ShiftIndex(clock)

eqs = [
    x(k) ~ 0.5x(k - 1) + u(k - 1),
    y ~ x
]
```

A few things to note in this basic example:

  - The equation `x(k+1) = 0.5x(k) + u(k)` has been rewritten in terms of negative shifts since positive shifts are not yet supported.
  - `x` and `u` are automatically inferred to be discrete-time variables, since they appear in an equation with a discrete-time [`ShiftIndex`](@ref) `k`.
  - `y` is also automatically inferred to be a discrete-time-time variable, since it appears in an equation with another discrete-time variable `x`. `x,u,y` all belong to the same discrete-time partition, i.e., they are all updated at the same *instantaneous point in time* at which the clock ticks.
  - The equation `y ~ x` does not use any shift index, this is equivalent to `y(k) ~ x(k)`, i.e., discrete-time variables without shift index are assumed to refer to the variable at the current time step.
  - The equation `x(k) ~ 0.5x(k-1) + u(k-1)` indicates how `x` is updated, i.e., what the value of `x` will be at the *current* time step in terms of the *past* value. The output `y`, is given by the value of `x` at the *current* time step, i.e., `y(k) ~ x(k)`. If this logic was implemented in an imperative programming style, the logic would thus be

```julia
function discrete_step(x, u)
    x = 0.5x + u # x is updated to a new value, i.e., x(k) is computed
    y = x # y is assigned the current value of x, y(k) = x(k)
    return x, y # The state x now refers to x at the current time step, x(k), and y equals x, y(k) = x(k)
end
```

An alternative and *equivalent* way of writing the same system is

```@example clocks
eqs = [
    x(k + 1) ~ 0.5x(k) + u(k),
    y(k) ~ x(k)
]
```

but the use of positive time shifts is not yet supported. Instead, we *shifted all indices* by `-1` above, resulting in exactly the same difference equations. However, the next system is *not equivalent* to the previous one:

```@example clocks
eqs = [
    x(k) ~ 0.5x(k - 1) + u(k),
    y ~ x
]
```

In this last example, `u(k)` refers to the input at the new time point `k`., this system is equivalent to

```
eqs = [
    x(k+1) ~ 0.5x(k) + u(k+1),
    y(k) ~ x(k)
]
```

## Higher-order shifts

The expression `x(k-1)` refers to the value of `x` at the *previous* clock tick. Similarly, `x(k-2)` refers to the value of `x` at the clock tick before that. In general, `x(k-n)` refers to the value of `x` at the `n`th clock tick before the current one. As an example, the Z-domain transfer function

```math
H(z) = \dfrac{b_2 z^2 + b_1 z + b_0}{a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + a_0}
```

may thus be modeled as

```julia
t = ModelingToolkit.t_nounits
@variables y(t) [description = "Output"] u(t) [description = "Input"]
k = ShiftIndex(Clock(t, dt))
eqs = [
    a2 * y(k) + a1 * y(k - 1) + a0 * y(k - 2) ~ b2 * u(k) + b1 * u(k - 1) + b0 * u(k - 2)
]
```

(see also [ModelingToolkitStandardLibrary](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkitStandardLibrary/stable/) for a discrete-time transfer-function component.)

## Initial conditions

The initial condition of discrete-time variables is defined using the [`ShiftIndex`](@ref) operator, for example

```julia
ODEProblem(model, [x(k) => 1.0], (0.0, 10.0))
```

If higher-order shifts are present, the corresponding initial conditions must be specified, e.g., the presence of the equation

```julia
x(k) = x(k - 1) + x(k - 2)
```

requires specification of the initial condition for both `x(k-1)` and `x(k-2)`.

## Multiple clocks

Multi-rate systems are easy to model using multiple different clocks. The following set of equations is valid, and defines *two different discrete-time partitions*, each with its own clock:

```julia
yd1 ~ Sample(t, dt1)(y)
ud1 ~ kp * (Sample(t, dt1)(r) - yd1)
yd2 ~ Sample(t, dt2)(y)
ud2 ~ kp * (Sample(t, dt2)(r) - yd2)
```

`yd1` and `ud1` belong to the same clock which ticks with an interval of `dt1`, while `yd2` and `ud2` belong to a different clock which ticks with an interval of `dt2`. The two clocks are *not synchronized*, i.e., they are not *guaranteed* to tick at the same point in time, even if one tick interval is a rational multiple of the other. Mechanisms for synchronization of clocks are not yet implemented.

## Accessing discrete-time variables in the solution

## A complete example

Below, we model a simple continuous first-order system called `plant` that is controlled using a discrete-time controller `controller`. The reference signal is filtered using a discrete-time filter `filt` before being fed to the controller.

```@example clocks
using ModelingToolkit, Plots, OrdinaryDiffEq
using ModelingToolkit: t_nounits as t
using ModelingToolkit: D_nounits as D
dt = 0.5 # Sample interval
@variables r(t)
clock = Clock(t, dt)
k = ShiftIndex(clock)

function plant(; name)
    @variables x(t)=1 u(t)=0 y(t)=0
    D = Differential(t)
    eqs = [D(x) ~ -x + u
           y ~ x]
    ODESystem(eqs, t; name = name)
end

function filt(; name) # Reference filter
    @variables x(t)=0 u(t)=0 y(t)=0
    a = 1 / exp(dt)
    eqs = [x(k) ~ a * x(k - 1) + (1 - a) * u(k)
           y ~ x]
    ODESystem(eqs, t, name = name)
end

function controller(kp; name)
    @variables y(t)=0 r(t)=0 ud(t)=0 yd(t)=0
    @parameters kp = kp
    eqs = [yd ~ Sample(y)
           ud ~ kp * (r - yd)]
    ODESystem(eqs, t; name = name)
end

@named f = filt()
@named c = controller(1)
@named p = plant()

connections = [r ~ sin(t)          # reference signal
               f.u ~ r             # reference to filter input
               f.y ~ c.r           # filtered reference to controller reference
               Hold(c.ud) ~ p.u    # controller output to plant input (zero-order-hold)
               p.y ~ c.y]          # plant output to controller feedback

@named cl = ODESystem(connections, t, systems = [f, c, p])
```
