# Importing FMUs

ModelingToolkit is able to import FMUs following the [FMI Standard](https://fmi-standard.org/) versions 2 and 3.
This integration is done through [FMI.jl](https://github.com/ThummeTo/FMI.jl) and requires importing it to
enable the relevant functionality. Currently Model Exchange (ME) and CoSimulation (CS) FMUs are supported.
Events, non-floating-point variables and array variables are not supported. Additionally, calculating the
time derivatives of FMU states/outputs is not supported.

!!! danger "Experimental"
    
    This functionality is currently experimental and subject to change without a breaking release of
    ModelingToolkit.jl.

## FMUs of full models

Here, we will demonstrate the usage of an FMU of an entire model (as opposed to a single component).
First, the required libraries must be imported and the FMU loaded using FMI.jl.

```@example fmi
using ModelingToolkit, FMI, FMIZoo, OrdinaryDiffEq
using ModelingToolkit: t_nounits as t, D_nounits as D

# This is a spring-pendulum FMU from FMIZoo.jl. It is a v2 FMU
# and we are importing it in ModelExchange format.
fmu = loadFMU("SpringPendulum1D", "Dymola", "2022x"; type = :ME)
```

Following are the variables in the FMU (both states and parameters):

```@example fmi
fmu.modelDescription.modelVariables
```

Next, [`FMIComponent`](@ref) is used to import the FMU as an MTK component. We provide the FMI
major version as a `Val` to the constructor, along with the loaded FMU and the type as keyword
arguments.

```@example fmi
@named model = ModelingToolkit.FMIComponent(Val(2); fmu, type = :ME)
```

Note how hierarchical names in the FMU (e.g. `mass.m` or `spring.f`) are turned into flattened
names, with `__` being the namespace separator (`mass__m` and `spring__f`).

!!! note
    
    Eventually we plan to reconstruct a hierarchical system structure mirroring the one indicated
    by the variables in the FMU. This would allow accessing the above mentioned variables as
    `model.mass.m` and `model.spring.f` instead of `model.mass__m` and `model.spring__f` respectively.

Derivative variables such as `der(mass.v)` use the dummy derivative notation, and are hence transformed
into a form similar to `mass__vˍt`. However, they can still be referred to as `D(model.mass__v)`.

```@example fmi
equations(model)
```

Since the FMI spec allows multiple names to alias the same quantity, ModelingToolkit.jl creates
equations to alias them. For example, it can be seen above that `der(mass.v)` and `mass.a` have the
same reference, and hence refer to the same quantity. Correspondingly, there is an equation
`mass__vˍt(t) ~ mass__a(t)` in the system.

!!! note
    
    Any variables and/or parameters that are not part of the FMU should be ignored, as ModelingToolkit
    creates them to manage the FMU. Unexpected usage of these variables/parameters can lead to errors.

```@example fmi
defaults(model)
```

All parameters in the FMU are given a default equal to their start value, if present. Unknowns are not
assigned defaults even if a start value is present, as this would conflict with ModelingToolkit's own
initialization semantics.

We can simulate this model like any other ModelingToolkit system.

```@repl fmi
sys = structural_simplify(model)
prob = ODEProblem(sys, [sys.mass__s => 0.5, sys.mass__v => 0.0], (0.0, 5.0))
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())
```

We can interpolate the solution object to obtain values at arbitrary time points in the solved interval,
just like a normal solution.

```@repl fmi
sol(0.0:0.1:1.0; idxs = sys.mass_a)
```

FMUs following version 3 of the specification can be simulated with almost the same process. This time,
we will create a model from a CoSimulation FMU.

```@example fmi
fmu = loadFMU("SpringPendulum1D", "Dymola", "2023x", "3.0"; type = :CS)
@named inner = ModelingToolkit.FMIComponent(
    Val(3); fmu, communication_step_size = 0.001, type = :CS,
    reinitializealg = BrownFullBasicInit())
```

This FMU has fewer equations, partly due to missing aliasing variables and partly due to being a CS FMU.
CoSimulation FMUs are bundled with an integrator. As such, they do not function like ME FMUs. Instead,
a callback steps the FMU at periodic intervals in time and obtains the updated state. This state is held
constant until the next time the callback triggers. The periodic interval must be specified through the
`communication_step_size` keyword argument. A smaller step size typically leads to less error but is
more computationally expensive.

This model alone does not have any differential variables, and calling `structural_simplify` will lead
to an `ODESystem` with no unknowns.

```@example fmi
structural_simplify(inner)
```

Simulating this model will cause the OrdinaryDiffEq integrator to immediately finish, and will not
trigger the callback. Thus, we wrap this system in a trivial system with a differential variable.

```@example fmi
@variables x(t) = 1.0
@mtkbuild sys = ODESystem([D(x) ~ x], t; systems = [inner])
```

We can now simulate `sys`.

```@example fmi
prob = ODEProblem(sys, [sys.inner.mass__s => 0.5, sys.inner.mass__v => 0.0], (0.0, 5.0))
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5())
```

The variables of the FMU are discrete, and their timeseries can be obtained at intervals of
`communication_step_size`.

```@example fmi
sol[sys.inner.mass__s]
```

## FMUs of components

FMUs can also be imported as individual components. For this example, we will use custom FMUs used
in the test suite of ModelingToolkit.jl.

```@example fmi
fmu = loadFMU(
    joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "..", "..", "test", "fmi", "fmus", "SimpleAdder.fmu");
    type = :ME)
fmu.modelDescription.modelVariables
```

This FMU is equivalent to the following model:

```julia
@mtkmodel SimpleAdder begin
    @variables begin
        a(t)
        b(t)
        c(t)
        out(t)
        out2(t)
    end
    @parameters begin
        value = 1.0
    end
    @equations begin
        out ~ a + b + value
        D(c) ~ out
        out2 ~ 2c
    end
end
```

`a` and `b` are inputs, `c` is a state, and `out` and `out2` are outputs of the component.

```@repl fmi
@named adder = ModelingToolkit.FMIComponent(
    Val(2); fmu, type = :ME, reinitializealg = BrownFullBasicInit());
isinput(adder.a)
isinput(adder.b)
isoutput(adder.out)
isoutput(adder.out2)
```

ModelingToolkit recognizes input and output variables of the component, and attaches the appropriate
metadata. We can now use this component as a subcomponent of a larger system.

```@repl fmi
@variables a(t) b(t) c(t) [guess = 1.0];
@mtkbuild sys = ODESystem(
    [adder.a ~ a, adder.b ~ b, D(a) ~ t,
        D(b) ~ adder.out + adder.c, c^2 ~ adder.out + adder.value],
    t;
    systems = [adder])
equations(sys)
```

Note how the output `adder.out` is used in an algebraic equation of the system. We have also given
`sys.c` a guess, expecting it to be solved for by initialization. ModelingToolkit is able to use
FMUs in initialization to solve for initial states. As mentioned earlier, we cannot differentiate
through an FMU. Thus, automatic differentiation has to be disabled for the solver.

```@example fmi
prob = ODEProblem(sys, [sys.adder.c => 2.0, sys.a => 1.0, sys.b => 1.0],
    (0.0, 1.0), [sys.adder.value => 2.0])
solve(prob, Rodas5P(autodiff = false))
```

CoSimulation FMUs follow a nearly identical process. Since CoSimulation FMUs operate using callbacks,
after triggering the callbacks and altering the discrete state the algebraic equations may no longer
be satisfied. To resolve for the values of algebraic variables, we use the `reinitializealg` keyword
of `FMIComponent`. This is a DAE initialization algorithm to use at the end of every callback. Since
CoSimulation FMUs are not directly involved in the RHS of the system - instead operating through
callbacks - we can use a solver with automatic differentiation.

```@example fmi
fmu = loadFMU(
    joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "..", "..", "test", "fmi", "fmus", "SimpleAdder.fmu");
    type = :CS)
@named adder = ModelingToolkit.FMIComponent(
    Val(2); fmu, type = :CS, communication_step_size = 1e-3,
    reinitializealg = BrownFullBasicInit())
@mtkbuild sys = ODESystem(
    [adder.a ~ a, adder.b ~ b, D(a) ~ t,
        D(b) ~ adder.out + adder.c, c^2 ~ adder.out + adder.value],
    t;
    systems = [adder])
prob = ODEProblem(sys, [sys.adder.c => 2.0, sys.a => 1.0, sys.b => 1.0],
    (0.0, 1.0), [sys.adder.value => 2.0])
solve(prob, Rodas5P())
```
