# Internal Details

This section documents the internal implementation details of ModelingToolkit. These APIs are not considered stable and may change without notice in non-breaking releases. They are documented here to help future contributors understand the library's inner workings.

## Overview

ModelingToolkit's internal architecture consists of several key components:

- **Structural Transformation**: Algorithms for transforming equation systems, including index reduction, tearing, and algebraic simplification
- **Bipartite Graphs**: Graph representations used to analyze relationships between equations and variables
- **System Structure**: Internal representations of system state and transformations

These components work together to enable ModelingToolkit's symbolic manipulation and code generation capabilities.

!!! warning
    The functions and types documented in this section are internal implementation details. Users should not rely on these APIs as they may change or be removed without deprecation warnings.
