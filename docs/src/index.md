# ModelingToolkit.jl: High-Performance Symbolic-Numeric Equation-Based Modeling

ModelingToolkit.jl is a modeling language for high-performance
symbolic-numeric computation in scientific computing and scientific machine learning.
It then mixes ideas from symbolic computational algebra systems with
causal and acausal equation-based modeling frameworks to give an extendable and
parallel modeling system. It allows for users to give a high-level description of
a model for symbolic preprocessing to analyze and enhance the model. Automatic
symbolic transformations, such as index reduction of differential-algebraic equations,
make it possible to solve equations that are impossible to solve
with a purely numeric-based technique.

## Installation

To install ModelingToolkit.jl, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ModelingToolkit")
```

## Feature Summary

ModelingToolkit.jl is a symbolic-numeric modeling package. Thus it combines some
of the features from symbolic computing packages like SymPy or Mathematica with
the ideas of equation-based modeling systems like the causal Simulink and the
acausal Modelica. It bridges the gap between many different kinds of equations,
allowing one to quickly and easily transform systems of DAEs into optimization
problems, or vice-versa, and then simplify and parallelize the resulting expressions
before generating code.

### Feature List

- Causal and acausal modeling (Simulink/Modelica)
- Automated model transformation, simplification, and composition
- Automatic conversion of numerical models into symbolic models
- Composition of models through the components, a lazy connection system, and
  tools for expanding/flattening
- Pervasive parallelism in symbolic computations and generated functions
- Transformations like alias elimination and tearing of nonlinear systems for
  efficiently numerically handling large-scale systems of equations
- The ability to use the entire Symbolics.jl Computer Algebra System (CAS) as
  part of the modeling process.
- Import models from common formats like SBML, CellML, BioNetGen, and more.
- Extensibility: the whole system is written in pure Julia, so adding new
  functions, simplification rules, and model transformations has no barrier.

is built on, consult the
[Symbolics.jl documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/Symbolics/stable/)

## Compatible Numerical Solvers

All of the symbolic systems have a direct conversion to a numerical system, which
can then be handled through the SciML interfaces. For example, after building a
model and performing symbolic manipulations, an `ODESystem` can be converted into
an `ODEProblem` to then be solved by a numerical ODE solver. Below is a list of
the solver libraries which are the numerical targets of the ModelingToolkit
system:

- [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/)
    - Multi-package interface of high performance numerical solvers for `ODESystem`,
      `SDESystem`, and `JumpSystem`
- [NonlinearSolve.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/NonlinearSolve/stable/)
    - High performance numerical solving of `NonlinearSystem`
- [Optimization.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/Optimization/stable/)
    - Multi-package interface for numerical solving `OptimizationSystem`
- [NeuralPDE.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/NeuralPDE/stable/)
    - Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) training on `PDESystem`
- [MethodOfLines.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/MethodOfLines/stable/)
    - Automated finite difference method (FDM) discretization of `PDESystem`
