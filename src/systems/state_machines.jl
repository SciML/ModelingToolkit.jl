    transition(from, to, cond; immediate::Bool = true, reset::Bool = true, synchronize::Bool = false, priority::Int = 1)

Create a transition from state `from` to state `to` that is enabled when transitioncondition `cond` evaluates to `true`.

# Arguments:
- `from`: The source state of the transition.
- `to`: The target state of the transition.
- `cond`: A transition condition that evaluates to a Bool, such as `ticksInState() >= 2`.
- `immediate`: If `true`, the transition will fire at the same tick as it becomes true, if `false`, the actions of the state are evaluated first, and the transition fires during the next tick.
- `reset`: If true, the destination state `to` is reset to its initial condition when the transition fires.
- `synchronize`: If true, the transition will only fire if all sub-state machines in the source state are in their final (terminal) state. A final state is one that has no outgoing transitions.
- `priority`: If a state has more than one outgoing transition, all outgoing transitions must have a unique priority. The transitions are evaluated in priority order, i.e., the transition with priority 1 is evaluated first.

    timeInState()
    timeInState(state)

Get the time (in seconds) spent in a state in a finite state machine.

When used to query the time spent in the enclosing state, the method without arguments is used, i.e.,
```julia
@mtkmodel FSM begin
    ...
    @equations begin
        var(k+1) ~ timeInState() >= 2 ? 0.0 : var(k)
    end
end
```

If used to query the residence time of another state, the state is passed as an argument.

This operator can be used in both equations and transition conditions.

This can be used to perform a unique action when entering a state.
