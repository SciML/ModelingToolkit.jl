    # The sparsity pattern of `nlsolve(f, u, p)` w.r.t `p` is difficult to
    # determine in general. Consider the "simplest" case, a linear system. We
    # have
    #                   A u = p.
    # Clearly, the sparsity of `u` depends on the sparsity of both `p` and `A`
    # in a non-trivial way. However, in the generic case, `u` is dense even when
    # `A` and `p` are sparse. For instance
    #
    # ```julia
    # julia> using Random, SparseArrays
    #
    # julia> A = sprand(MersenneTwister(1234), 100, 100, 0.1);
    #
    # julia> p = sprand(MersenneTwister(12345), 100, 0.05);
    #
    # julia> count(x->abs(x) < 1e-5, A \ Vector(p))
    # 0
    # ```
    #
    # Let 𝑇 be the set of tearing variables and 𝑉 be the set of all *unknowns* in
    # the residual equations. In the following code, we are going to assume the
    # connection between 𝑇 (the `u` in from above) and 𝑉 ∖ 𝑇 (the `p` in from
    # above) has full incidence.
    #
    # Note that as we are reducing algebraic equations numerically, it could be
    # the case that a later partition (a BLT block) contains tearing variables
    # from other partitions.
    #
    # We know that partitions are BLT ordered. Hence, the tearing variables in
    # each partition is unique, and all unknowns in a partition must be
    # either differential variables or algebraic tearing variables that are
    # from previous partitions. Hence, we can build the dependency chain as we
    # traverse the partitions.
