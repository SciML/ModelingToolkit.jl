Computes which variables are the "highest-differentiated" for purposes of

case, there is one complicating condition:

    We allow variables in the structure graph that don't appear in the
    system at all. What we are interested in is the highest-differentiated
    variable that actually appears in the system.

This function takes care of these complications are returns a boolean array
