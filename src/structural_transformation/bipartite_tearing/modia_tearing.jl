    # compute the strongly connected components. In the absence of cycles and
    # non-solvability, a maximal matching on the original graph will give us an
    # optimal assignment. However, even with cycles, we can use the maximal matching
    # to give us a good starting point for a good matching and then proceed to
    # reverse edges in each scc to improve the solution. Note that it is possible

    # same set of strongly connected components, but the associated equations need
    # not be the same. In the absence of solvability constraints, this may be a
    # small issue, but here it is possible that an equation got assigned to an
    # scc that cannot actually use it for solving a variable, but still precludes
    # another scc from using it. To avoid this, we delete any assignments that
