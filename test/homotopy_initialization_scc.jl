# Modelica `homotopy(actual, simplified)` nodes are handled PER SCC: the initialization
# system still tears into `SCCNonlinearProblem` blocks, but a block whose equations carry
# `homotopy` nodes is built as a `SciMLBase.HomotopyProblem` (λ-swept residual) and solved
# by continuation, while the remaining blocks keep their plain Newton solves. Blocks are
# solved in dependency order, so each reaches `λ = 1` before the next begins.
#
# The fixture is a chain `a -> b -> c` of algebraic equations, which tears into three
# sequential SCC blocks — a single-equation init system degrades to a plain
# `NonlinearProblem` inside the `SCCNonlinearProblem` constructor and would not exercise
# this path at all. Only the `a` block carries a `homotopy` node.
